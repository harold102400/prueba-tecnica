- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install XAMPP and start/activate the Apache and MySQL modules.
- Install Composer in your computer, you can get it from this website https://getcomposer.org/download/ and once it is installed in your computer, you need to run in your terminal inside the project the command **composer install** to install the project dependencies.
- In Postman you will use http://localhost/api/users, which is the endpoint for the routes.
- For the database functionality, create a database in MySQL named "user_data" and import the table called "database.sql"

## ABOUT THE PROJECT <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b0/4a/09/b04a095495f81d26da9801a1d58ec0c3.jpg" width="50px" height="50px"></img>

This is an API REST using the MVC pattern design with object-oriented programming, and the project uses Composer, which is a package management tool in PHP. To handle the routes, the Bramus Router library was installed via Composer.

## ENJOY! <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f6/37/3a/f6373a8a19ab5af63784e4d303d84581.jpg" width="50px" height="50px"></img>
